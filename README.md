### Face Detection & Gender Classification on WebCam
Implementation of face detection and gender classification on WebCam. Face Detection was done using [OpenCV Haar-Cascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) and Gender Classification was done using Convolutional Neural Network. The trained model was loaded from my previous project [GenderClassification](https://github.com/Nahid1992/ImageClassification--GenderClassifier_using_TFLearn).
